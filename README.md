Note from William Whitmore

This code is here for sample purposes and is not a complete package.

Within the cogniven_code folder there are 5 directories; cogniven_account, cogniven_checkout, cogniven_gamelinks, cogniven_webform, and Imaiy  
 - cogniven_account, cogniven_checkout, cogniven_gamelinks, and cogniven_webform were modules to be used with the Drupal CMS that was used to build our main website.
    - cogniven_account: Cogniven-specific modifications to handle cogniven accounts and game logins.  
    - cogniven_checkout: Adds a pane to the checkout process to allow specification of virtual goods delivery target.  
    - cogniven_gamelinks: Cogniven-specific block to supply links to games.  
    - cogniven_webform: Customizations for the Webform module to collect specific data  
  
 - Imaiy contains the code for the game Battle for Imaiy with a screenshot included in repo. No other artwork is inlcluded.
